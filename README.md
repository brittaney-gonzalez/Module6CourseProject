# Credits
Brittaney Gonzalez is a hard working individual that was inspired to better her health after her brother joined the military. She began her initial workout journey alone. Others were inspired by her progress and had a desire to join her journey. Healthy Happy You originated from a group of friends that enjoyed working out together. The desire to be healthier formed a strong connection and the desire to help others resulted in this group. Each member of the team is great at what they do.
